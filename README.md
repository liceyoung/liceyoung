Hi,
I am Thao /θ:aʊ/ (Alice)

As a junior at Beloit College, WI. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, and I have a strong passion for applying technology to tackle complex problems with scalability. I am also a Lead of the Google Developer Student Clubs at my college, where I foster learning and connections among peers who share my interest in technology exploration and innovation.

In addition to being an Undergrad Teaching Assistant for two courses, Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Architecture, I actively participate in hackathons, project-based initiatives, and entrepreneurship workshops. I enjoy exploring new programming languages and frameworks for my personal projects, such as Python, C, Kotlin, React, Next.js, and Node.js and MongoDB. After graduating, I hope to work as a full-time software engineer in the technology industry, where I can enhance my skills and knowledge and contribute to efficient and effective solutions. In my free time, I like playing sports, dancing hiphop, and singing.
